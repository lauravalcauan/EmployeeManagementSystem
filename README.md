# EmployeeManagementSystem

The aim of this project is to make life easier for admins and also for the user which in this case is the employee. The admin can keep track of the employee's
activity, to assign/delete tasks. Employees can keep track their progress for each task and see other employees profiles. The application is a "web page" like,
uses Spring boot for that and for the frontend part are present elements of Bootstrap, CSS, HTML.
